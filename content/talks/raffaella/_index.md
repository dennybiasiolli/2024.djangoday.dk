Discover how the Djangonaut Space program transformed my professional path from a junior developer to an active member of the Django community. I'll share my experiences, the challenges I faced, and the lessons I learned along the way.

During my journey, collaboration and support were the keys to my growth. I aim to encourage others to become new open source contributors and demonstrate how a positive environment can empower individuals to become active members of a community.
