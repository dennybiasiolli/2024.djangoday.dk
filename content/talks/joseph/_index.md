Is marrying Django and FastAPI something you should do? No.

But there are specific cases where it makes sense to do so. Care has to be taken for them to work nicely together. Some guardrails need to be put in place.

The suggested approach is by no means "the best" approach. However it's an approach that is embedded in a team's CI/CD flow, and as a result deployed to a production environment.

## About Joseph

I‚Äôm Joseph. I am in software engineering since the ‚Äò00s. Working professionally since ‚Äò06.

Most of the time my roles were ‚Äúbackend‚Äù. Where working with data and relational databases is a key part of backend.

From ‚Äò08 onwards I worked a lot with Python. And the framework I worked with most is Django.
